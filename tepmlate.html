      <h1>Bruno the Pug</h1>
      <p> Hi, I am Bruno the Pug. Nice to meet you. </p>
      <p> I am owned by the Brar Family. Purchased by Kiran Brar. My mother is Sukhdial Brar.    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> I like to eat treats. </li>
        <li> I like to go park for walks </li>
        <li> I like smell other dogs bollocks </li>
        <li> I don't like black people. For what reason I do not know. </li>
        <li> I somewhat like my brother Blu. (He's acc a dickhead.) </li>
      </ul>
      <p> My day usually goes like: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Wake up. </li>
        <li> Jump on everyones bed. </li>
        <li> Roll around on the carpet downstairs. </li>
        <li> Eat breakfast. </li>
        <li> Go for walk </li>
        <li> Poo on said walk. </li>
        <li> Drink some water. </li>
        <li> Sleep. </li>
      </ol>
      <p> That is a produvtive day for my life as a Pug.
      <p> Being a Pug isn't so bad after all, especially when you have a great family looking after you.</p>
      <p> My birth day is in September. I am nearly <em>three years</em> old, so in human years that would mean I am <em>twenty-eight</em> years old.</p>
